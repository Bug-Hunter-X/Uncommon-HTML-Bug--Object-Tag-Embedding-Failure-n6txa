# Uncommon HTML Bug: Object Tag Embedding Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to the &lt;object&gt; tag and provides a solution.

The bug occurs when the path to the embedded file is incorrect or when there is a MIME type mismatch between the declared type and the server's response.

## Bug Description

The bug involves the use of the HTML &lt;object&gt; tag to embed external content, such as a PDF file.  If the file path is incorrect or the server returns an unexpected MIME type, the browser might not display the embedded content correctly, resulting in a blank space or an error.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling and verification of the server response to ensure correct MIME type and content.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.  You should see a broken embedded object.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to view the corrected implementation.

## Note

This bug is uncommon because it's less frequently encountered compared to more common issues such as syntax errors or missing closing tags.  However, it can create unexpected behaviour if not carefully addressed.
