<p>The solution involves implementing error handling to gracefully handle situations where the embedded file is not found or a MIME type mismatch occurs.</p><p>This example utilizes a fallback mechanism that displays an alternative message if the object embedding fails. Additional mechanisms such as checking the HTTP status code returned by the server can be implemented for enhanced error handling.  Consider using Javascript's `fetch` or a similar API to retrieve HTTP headers or the response status code before trying to embed the resource.</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;object data="correct-path.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="500" height="300"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your browser does not support PDFs.  Alternatively, a failure to load this object may have occurred due to network issues or the incorrect file path.&lt;/p&gt;
